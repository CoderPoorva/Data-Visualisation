# Data-Visualisation

This project was a collaborative effort led by me, and I extend my gratitude to my team members - Rohan Ghosh, Pushkar Pan, Shruti Paral, and Anushri Roy - for their valuable contributions. A special thanks to our trainer, Mr. Arghadip Chakraborty, for patiently addressing our doubts and guiding us through the project.

We have worked on the Cyber Crime (2017-2020) dataset. We did a detailed analysis with the python libraries-numpy, pandas, matplot and seaborn. 
Go and check it out. :)
